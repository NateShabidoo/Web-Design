<h1>Industrial Design, CAD, Prototyping</h1>
<p>We are taking CAD and Industrial Design to the next level.  Working in the industry for a number of years I have developed skills you would find at some of the best consultancies.  Spending most of my career in consultancy and corporate environments I understand the process necessary to develop winning products, from concept ideation to final tooling design. 
At a past position I was the fastest Soldworks designer in the company (25 people). One big differentiator between Advanced Designs and other consultancies is pricing - with Advanced Designs you are getting one of the larger firms best talents for a better price.  In some instances we can be up to 50% cheaper than high rates charged by big firms.</p>

<h3>When evolution becomes revolution, that is what we do</h3>
<p>When I approach client projects I often send an initial sketch or model right away to make sure we are on the same page and aren't wasting hours on something the client doesn't want.  After that I make sure to present a wide variety of concepts to give the client many options, zeroing in from there on a final direction.  Often when the CAD starts is where I will save you the most money.                                                           </p>
